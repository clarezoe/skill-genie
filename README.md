A curated collection of reusable skills and workflows that turn everyday tasks into fast, repeatable actions.

## Why this exists

Most personal automation fails because the best methods live in scattered notes. This repo turns those methods into clear, reusable skills that are easy to find, run, and improve.

## What's inside

- Skill folders with their own `SKILL.md` and supporting assets.
- References and scripts that keep each skill practical and maintainable.

## How to use

1. Browse a skill folder that matches your task.
2. Open the `SKILL.md` to follow the workflow.
3. Use included scripts or templates to save time.

## Add a new skill

- Keep it focused on a single job.
- Document the happy path and edge cases in `SKILL.md`.
- Include scripts or assets when they remove manual work.

## Principles

- Small, composable skills over monoliths.
- Clear steps over clever tricks.
- Practical defaults with room to customize.
